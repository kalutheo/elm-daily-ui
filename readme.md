# ELM Daily UI
This is a revisited version of the daily Ui Challenge in ELM.
The main purpose of this initiative is to practice this wonderful language by building some cool stuff.

My inspiration :

- http://www.jackoliver.info/react-daily-ui/
- http://www.dailyui.co/
- http://codepen.io

I'm trying to make all the examples runnable with elm-reactor..
When i will get into ports and subscriptions, I will maybe need to change that ... but for now it works :-)

## How to run it

- In case you don't have ELM :
```bash
,pm install elm -g
```

- In the root of your Elm project start the reactor with:
```bash
elm-reactor
```
