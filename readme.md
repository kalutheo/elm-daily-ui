# ELM Daily UI
This is a revisited version of the daily Ui Challenge in ELM.
The main purpose of this initiative is to practice this awesome language by building some cool stuff.

My inspiration :

- http://www.jackoliver.info/react-daily-ui/
- http://www.dailyui.co/
- http://codepen.io

- Simple examples can be launched with elm-reactor
- The one using interop features such as ports must be launched with the elm-app command from create-react-app

## How to run it

- In case you don't have ELM :
```bash
npm install elm -g
elm-package install
```

- In the root of your Elm project start the reactor with :
```bash
elm-reactor
```

- For examples built with create-react-app :
```bash
npm install create-elm-app -g
elm-package install
elm-app start
```
